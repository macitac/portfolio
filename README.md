### Summary
I am a motivated Statistics and Data Science student with a passion for data and machine learning. Seeking opportunities to apply the knowledge gained during my education. I am hardworking and love new challenges, especially within the realm of statistical analysis and statistical learning tasks. 

### Education
Master's degree in Statistics and Data Science, August 2023 - June 2025, Uppsala University
- The program provides a broad foundation in statistics and data analysis. It covers classical statistical concepts combined with a strong focus on machine learning, Bayesian statistics and AI.

Bachelor's Degree in Economics, January 2021 - June 2023, Uppsala University
- Economic degree with a strong focus on statistics. My bachelor thesis combined economics with machine learning and prediction models.

Basic Military Training, September 2019 - June 2020, Swedish armed forces
- Rifleman/Mounted Guard

### Work Experience
Research Assistant, October 2024 - Present, Department of Peace and Conflict, Uppsala
- Responsible for the data engineering, statistical analysis and visualization for a research project at the department of Peace and Conflict. 

Data Management, November 2022 - January 2023, Menigo Foodservice AB
- Worked in a project where we digitalized a database of contracts  at Menigo Foodservice.

Head of Finance, January 2022 - December 2022, Studentradion
- Responsible for the finances and accounting at the student organisation Studentradion at Uppsala University
- Served as a boardmember

Swedish armed forces - June 2020 - January 2021
- Served as a Rifleman/Mounted Guard at the cavalry in Stockholm

Webshop Employee, June 2019 - August 2024, Myrorna
- Temporary substitute during holidays; work involved using Sello, photographing and packaging goods, as well as handling customer service inquiries.


### Projects
Master thesis - Robotics and AI
- I am currently writing my master thesis in robotics and AI. In collaboration with Shanghai University I will be utalizing deep learning models to train a humanoid robot to imitate human motions. I expect to learn a lot within reinforcement and imitation learning as well as softwares and languages such as ROS, isaac gym and C++

Bachelor Thesis: Improving house price prediction models - Exploring the impact of macroeconomic features 
[Publication](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-4629&pid=diva2%3A1765541&c=43&searchType=SIMPLE&language=sv&query=Max+Hansson&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all)
- My Bachelor thesis revolved around trying to optimize a prediction model for house prices. Previous works put a lot of effort into hyperparameter tuning and model optimization. Me and my thesis partner instead wanted to explore the impact of the actual features put into the prediction model. Using a combination of different macroeconomic features we managed to significantly improve the house price prediction model.

  
Deepfake detection using Convolutional neural networks 
[Image Detection.pdf](https://github.com/macitac/portfolio/blob/main/Deepfake%20Image%20Detection.pdf)
- Developed two different convolutional neural networks in pytorch, comparing and evaluating them on the task of detecting deepfaked vs real images.
- Created one model from scratch and compared its performance to a model utalizing transfer learning from the Densenet121 model. 

Evaluating predictive performance of Bayesian regression models 
[Bayesian regression.pdf](https://github.com/macitac/portfolio/blob/main/Evaluating%20predictive%20performance%20of%20Bayesian%20regression%20models.pdf)
- Developed and implemented hierarchical regression models using rstan. Again using data for house price predictions, but exploring Bayesian methods instead of machine learning.
