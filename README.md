# Statistics and Data Science Student
### Summary
I am a motivated Statistics and Data Science student with a passion for data and machine learning. Seeking opportunities to apply the knowledge gained during my education. I am hardworking and love new challenges, especially within the realm of statistical analysis and statistical learning tasks. 

### Education
Master's degree in Statistics and Data Science, August 2023 - June 2025, Uppsala University
- The program provides a broad foundation in statistics and data analysis. It covers classical statistical concepts combined with a strong focus on machine learning, Bayesian statistics and AI.

Bachelor's Degree in Economics, January 2021 - June 2023, Uppsala University
- Economic degree with a strong focus on statistics. My bachelor thesis combined economics with machine learning and prediction models.

Basic Military Training, September 2019 - June 2020, Swedish armed forces
- Rifleman/Mounted Guard

### Work Experience
Reaserch Assistant, October 2024 - Present, Department of Peace and Conflict, Uppsala
- Responsible for the data engineering, statistical analysis and visualization for a research project at the department of Peace and Conflict. 

Data Management, November 2022 - January 2023, Menigo Foodservice AB
- Worked in a project where we digitalized a database of contracts  at Menigo Foodservice.

Head of Finance, January 2022 - December 2022, Studentradion
- Responsible for the finances and accounting at the student organisation Studentradion at Uppsala University
- Served as a boardmember

Swedish armed forces - June 2020 - January 2021

Webshop Employee, June 2019 - August 2024, Myrorna
- Temporary substitute during holidays; work involved using Sello, photographing and packaging goods, as well as handling customer service inquiries.


### Projects
Master thesis - Robotics and AI
- I am currently writing my master thesis in robotics and AI. In collaboration with Shanghai University I will be utalizing deep learning models to train a humanoid robot to imitate human motions. I expect to learn a lot within reinforcement and imiation learning as well as softwares such as ROS, isaac gym and C++

Bachelor Thesis - Using machine learning models as well as macroeconomic features to improve house price prediction models
- My Bachelor thesis revolved around trying to optimize a prediction model for house prices. Previous works put a lot of effort into hyperparameter tuning and model optimization. Me and my thesis partner instead wanted to explore the impact of the actual features put into the prediction model. Using a combination of different macroeconomic features we managed to significantly improve the house price prediction model.


### Skills
- R: For the majority of my education, I have been using R for statistical analyis, visualization etc making me very comfortable in this programming language.
- Python: This has been my go to language for machine learning and AI tasks. For the most part, i have been working in pytorch when constructing neural networks. 
- Visma: I used visma extensively during my work in accounting for Studentradion
- LaTeX: LaTeX has been the primary document compiling language used during my education.
- Stata: I have gained some stata knowledge during my time at the department of Peace and Conflict.
